## Welcome to q3dmmi

This is a hobby project I started from 2007.
The purpose is to use modern widget lib with opengl support to draw hardware accel. vector graphics(maps).

## History
- Due to work requirement, 2D vector graphics engine was explored. Linux/Xlib/motif was the platform used.
- Initial attemp of using gtk/gtkglext was performed. Later it turned to be a demo project for the employer and became propriete.
- QT drew my attention on 2013 but it had poor support for opengl by the time. With the release of QT5, the time became ripe, an initial version was release in 2014.
- Hence the project halted.

## Howto
Check [wiki](https://github.com/jiangfeng79/q3dmmi/wiki) for building guide

I wish the project could help people who are doing GIS systems and demands fluent performance with PC hardware.
