## Welcome to q3dmmi

This is a hobby project I started from 2007.
The purpose is to use modern widget lib with opengl support to draw hardware accel. vector graphics(maps).

Screenshots will be provided.

## History
Due to work requirement, 2D vector graphics engine is explored. Linux/Xlib/motif was the platform used.
Initial attemp of using gtk/gtkglext was performed. Later it becomes a demo project for the employer and it becomes propriete.
QT draws my attention on 2013 but it has poor support for opengl by the time. With the release of QT5, the time become ripe, an initial version was release in 2014.
Hence the project halts.

I wish the project could help people who are doing GIS systems and demands fluent performance with PC hardware.
